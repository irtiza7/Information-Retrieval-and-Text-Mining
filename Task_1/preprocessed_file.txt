Abstract 
This paper describes an application of APE the 
Atlas Planning Engine an integrated planning and 
execution system at the heart of the Atlas dialogue 
management system APE controls a mixed 
initiative dialogue between a human user and a 
host system where turns in the conversation may 
include graphical actions andor written text APE 
has full unification and can handle arbitrarily 
nested discourse constructs making it more 
powerful than dialogue managers based on finite 
state machines We illustrate this work by 
describing AtlasAndes an intelligent tutoring 
system built using APE with the Andes physics 
tutor as the host 
 Introduction 
The purpose of the Atlas project is to enlarge the 
scope of student interaction in an intelligent 
tutoring system ITS to include coherent 
conversational sequences including both written 
text and GUI actions A key component of Atlas 
is APE the Atlas Planning Engine a justin 
time planner specialized for easy construction 
and quick generation of hierarchically organized 
dialogues APE is a domain and taskindependent 
system Although to date we have used APE as a 
dialogue manager for intelligent tutoring systems 
APE could also be used to manage other types of 
humancomputer conversation such as an advice 
giving system or an interactive help system 
Planning is an essential component of a 
dialoguebased ITS Although there are many 
reasons for using natural anguage in an ITS as 
soon as the student gives an unexpected response 
to a tutor question the tutor needs to be able to

plan in order to achieve its goals as well as 
respond appropriately to the students tatement 
Yet classical planning is inappropriate for 
dialogue generation precisely because it assumes 
an unchanging world A more appropriate 
approach is the practical reason approach 
pioneered by Bratman   According to 
Bratman human beings maintain plans and prefer 
to follow them but they are also capable of 
changing the plans on the fly when needed 
Bratmans approach has been introduced into 
computer science under the name of reactive 
planning Georgeff and Ingrand  Wilkins et 
al  
In this paper we discuss the rationale for the use 
of reactive planning as well as the use of the 
hierarchical task network HTN style of plan 
operators Then we describe APE the Atlas 
Planning Engine a dialogue planner we have 
implemented to embody the above concepts We 
demonstrate he use of APE by showing how we 
have used it to add a dialogue capability to an 
existing ITS the Andes physics tutor By showing 
dialogues that AtlasAndes can generate we 
demonstrate the advantages of this architecture 
over the finitestate machine approach to dialogue 
management 
 Integrated planning and execution for 
dialogue generation 
 Practical reason and the BDI model 
For an ITS planning is required in order to ensure 
a coherent conversation as well as to accomplish 
tutorial goals But it is impossible to plan a whole 
conversation in advance when the student can 
respond freely at every turn just as human beings 
cannot plan their daily lives in advance because of 
possible changes in conditions Classical planning 
algorithms are inappropriate because the tutor 
must be able to change plans based on the 
 
students responses 
For this reason we have adopted the ideas of the 
philosopher Michael Bratman   
Bratman uses the term practical reason to 
describe his analysis since he is concerned with 
how to reason about practical matters For human 
beings planning is required in order to 
accomplish ones goals Bratmans key insight is 
that human beings tend to follow a plan once they 
have one although they are capable of dropping 
an intention or changing a partial plan when 
necessary In other words human beings do not 
decide what to do from scratch at each turn 
Bratman and others who have adopted his 
approach use a tripartite mental model that 
includes beliefs desires and intentions Bratman 
Israel and Pollack  Pollack  Georgeff 
et al  hence the name BDI model 
Beliefs which are uninstantiated plans in the 
speakers head are reified by the plan library 
Desires are expressed as the agents goals 
Intentions or plan steps that the agent has 
committed to but not yet acted on are stored in an 
agenda Thus the agents partial plan for 
achieving a goal is a network of intentions A plan 
can be left in a partially expanded state until it is 
necessary to refine it further 
 Implementation via reactive planning 
Bratmans approach has been elaborated in a 
computer science context by subsequent 
researchers Bratman Israel and Pollack  
Pollack  Georgeff et al  Reactive 
planning Georgeff and Ingrand  Wilkins et 
al  originally known as integrated 
planning and execution is one way of 
implementing Bratmans model Originally 
developed for realtime control of the space 
shuttle reactive planning has since been used in a 
variety of other domains For the Atlas project we 
have developed a reactive planner called APE 
Atlas Planning Engine which uses these ideas to 
conduct a conversation After each student 
response the planner can choose to continue with 
its previous intention or change something in the 
plan to respond better to the students utterance 
Like most reactive planners APE is a 
hierarchical task network HTN style planner 
Yang  Erol Hendler and Nau  
Hierarchical decomposition asserts that each goal 
can be achieved via a series of subgoals instead of 
relying on meansend reasoning Hierarchical 
decomposition is more appropriate to dialogue 
generation for a number of reasons First 
decomposition is better suited to the type of large 
scale dialogue planning required in a realworld 
tutoring system as it is easier to establish what a 
human speaker will say in a given situation than 
to be able to understand why in sufficient detail 
and generality to do meansend planning Second 
Hierarchical decomposition minimizes search 
time Third our dialogues are taskoriented and 
have a hierarchical structure Grosz and Sidner 
 In such a case matching the structure of 
the domain simplifies operator development 
because they can often be derived from transcripts 
of human tutoring sessions The hierarchy 
information is also useful in determining 
appropriate referring expressions Fourth inter 
leaved planning and execution is important for 
dialogue generation because we cannot predict he 
human users future utterances In an HTNbased 
system it is straightforward to implement 
interleaved planning and execution because one 
only needs to expand the portion of the plan that 
is about to be executed Finally the conversation 
is in a certain sense the trace of the plan In other 
words we care much more about the actions 
generated by the planner than the states involved 
whether implicitly or explicitly specified 
Hierarchical decomposition provides this trace 
naturally 
 Background the Andes physics tutor 
Andes Gertner Conati and VanLehn  is an 
intelligent tutoring system in the domain of first 
year college physics Andes teaches via coached 
problem solving VanLehn  In coached 
problem solving the tutoring system tracks the 
student as the latter attempts to solve a problem 
If the student gets stuck or deviates too far from a 
correct solution path the tutoring system provides 
hints and other assistance 
A sample Andes problem is shown in mid 
solution in Figure  A physics problem is given 
in the upperleft corner with a picture below it 
Next to the picture the student has begun to 
sketch the vectors involved using the GUI buttons 
along the lefthand edge of the screen As the 
 
student draws vectors Andes and the student 
cooperatively fill in the variable definitions in the 
upperright corner Later the student will use the 
space below to write equations connecting the 
variables 
In this example the elevator is decelerating so 
the acceleration vector should face the opposite 
direction from the velocity vector If the 
acceleration vector went the same direction as the 
velocity vector the speed of the elevator would 
increase and it would crash into the ground This 
is an important issue in beginning physics it 
occurs in five Andes problems 
When such errors occur Andes turns the 
incorrect item red and provides hints to students 
in the lowerleft corner of the screen A sample of 
these hints shown in the order a student would 
encounter them is shown in Fig  But hints are 
an outputonly form of natural language the 
student cant take the initiative or ask a question 
In addition there is no way for the system to ask 
the student a question or lead the student through 
a multistep directed line of reasoning Thus there 
is no way to use some of the effective rhetorical 
methods used by skilled human tutors such as 
analogy and reductio ad absurdum Current 
psychological research suggests that active 
methods where students have to answer 
questions will improve the performance of 
tutoring systems 
 Structure of the Atlas Planning Engine 
Figure shows a sample plan operator For 
legibility the key elements have been rendered in 
English instead of in Lisp The hiercx slot 
provides a way for the planner to be aware of the 
context in which a decomposition is proposed 
Items in the hiercx slot are instantiated and added 
to the transient database only so long as the 
operator which spawned them is in the agenda 
To initiate a planning session the user invokes 
the planner with an initial goal The system 
searches the operator library to find all operators 
whose goal field matches the next goal on the 
agenda and whose filter conditions and precon

Figure  Andes hint sequence formatted as dialogue 
ditions are satisfied Goals are represented in 
firstorder logic without quantifiers and matched 
via unification Since APE is intended especially 
for generation of hierarchically organized task 
oriented iscourse each operator has a multistep 
recipe in the style of Wilkins  When a 
match is found the matching goal is removed 
from the agenda and is replaced by the steps in 
the recipe APE has two kinds of primitive 
actions one ends a turn and the other doesnt 
From the point of view of discourse generation 
the most important APE recipe items are those 
allowing the planner to change the agenda when 
necessary These three types of recipe items make 
APE more powerful than a classical planner 
• Fact Evaluate a condition If false skip the 
rest of the recipe Fact is used to allow runtime 
decision making by bypassing the rest of an 
operator when circumstances change during its 
execution Fact can be used with retryat to 
implement a loop just as in Prolog 
• Retryat The purpose of retryat is to allow 
the planner to back up to a choice point and make 
a new decision It removes goals sequentially 
from the top of the agenda a full operator at a 
time until the supplied argument is false Then it 
restores the parent goal of the last operator 
removed so that further planning can choose a 
new way to achieve it Retryat implements a
Prologlike choice of alternatives but it differs 
from backtracking in that the new operator is 
chosen based on conditions that apply when the 
retry operation is executed rather than on a list of 
possible operators formed when the original 
operator was chosen For retryat o be useful the 
author must provide multiple operators for the 
same goal Each operator must have a set of 
preconditions enabling it to be chosen at the 
appropriate ime

to allow the planner to remove goals from the 
agenda based on a change in circumstances It 
removes goals sequentially from the top of the 
agenda one at a time until the supplied argument 
becomes false Then it replaces the removed goals 
with an optional ist of new goals Prunereplace 
allows a type of decisionmaking frequently used 
in dialogue generation When a conversation 
partner does not give the expected response one 
would often like to remove the next goal from the 
agenda and replace it with one or more 
replacement goals Prunereplace implements a
generalized version of this concept 
APE is domainindependent a d communicates 
with a host system via an API As a partner in a 
dialogue it needs to obtain information from the 
world as well as produce output turns 
Preconditions on plan operators can be used to 
access information from external knowledge 
sources APE contains a recipe item type that can 
be used to execute an external program such as a 
call to a GUI interface APE also has recipe items 
allowing the user to assert and retract facts in a 
knowledge base Further details about the APE 
planner can be found in Freedman  
 Implementation of At lasAndes 
 Architecture of AtlasAndes 
The first system we have implemented with APE 
is a prototype AtlasAndes system that replaces 
the hints usually given for an incorrect 
acceleration vector by a choice of generated 
subdialogues Figure  shows the architecture of 
AtlasAndes any other system built with APE 
would look similar Robust natural language 
understanding in AtlasAndes is provided by

 Structure of human tutorial dialogues 
In an earlier analysis Kim Freedman and Evens 
 we showed that a significant portion of 
humanhuman tutorial dialogues can be modeled 
with the hierarchical structure of taskoriented 
dialogues Grosz and Sidner  Furthermore 
a main building block of the discourse hierarchy 
corresponding to the transaction level in

To obtain empirical data for the AtlasAndes 
plan operators we analyzed portions of a corpus 
of human tutors helping students olve similar 
physics problems Two experienced tutors were 
used Tutor A was a graduate student in computer 
science who had majored in physics tutor B was 
a professional physics tutor 
The complete corpus contained solutions to five 
physics problems by  students each We 
analyzed every tutoring episode dealing with the 
acceleration vector during deceleration totaling 
 examples divided among  students and both 
tutors The tutors had very different styles 
Tutor A tended to provide encouragement rather 
than content making those transcripts less useful 
for deriving an informationbased approach 
Tutor B used an informationbased approach but 
after one wrong answer tended to complete the 
solution as a monologue Largely following 
tutor Bs approach to sequence and content we 
isolated six ways of teaching the student about 
direction of acceleration 
 Sample output and evaluation 
Figure  shows an example of text that can be 
generated by the AtlasAndes ystem showing an 
analogybased approach to teaching this content 
The operator library used to generate this text 
could generate a combinatorially arge number of 
versions of this dialogue as well as selected 
examples of other ways of teaching about 
direction of acceleration 
This operator library used to generate this text 
contained l  plan operators divided as follows

We are currently working on components hat will 
allow us to increase the number of physics 
concepts covered without a corresponding 
increase in the number of operators The schema 
switching operators prevent the tutor from 
repeating itself during a physics problem They 
could be reduced or eliminated by a general 
discourse history component that tutoring schema 
operators could refer to Domaindependent 
lexical insertion refers to the choice of lexical 
items such as car and east in the sample dialogue 
while domainindependent iexical insertion refers 
to items such as OK and exactly Both categories 
could be eliminated or at least severely reduced 
through the use of a text realization package 
Together that would provide a onethird reduction 
in the number of operators needed As the set of 
API and GUI handling operators is fixed that 
would reduce by half the number of application 
operators needed 
The largest remaining category of operators is 
the answer handlers These operators handle a 
variety of answers for each of the five questions 
that the system can ask The answers we 
recognize include categories such as dont 
know as well as specific answers eg a direction 
perpendicular to the correct answer which we 
recognize because the tutor has specific replies 
for them In order to reduce the number of 
S draws acceleration vector in same direction as velocity 
T What is the definition of acceleration 
S Dont know 
T OK lets try this If a car was driving along east which way would you have to push on it 
to make it stop 
S West 
T Exactly The opposite direction So the net force goes the opposite direction and so does 
the acceleration Try to draw the acceleration vector again now 
S draws acceleration vector correctly

operators further we must investigate more 
general methods of handling student errors In 
particular we plan to investigate errorclassifying 
predicates that apply to more than one question as 
well as the use of intentionbased predicates 
Since the system only covers one rule of physics 
albeit in a variety of ways we plan to make some 
of these efficiency improvements before adding 
new rules of physics and testing it with users 
Preconditions for the operators in the plan 
library utilize discourse or interaction history the 
current goal hierarchy recent information such as 
the tutors current goal and the students latest 
response shared information such as a model of 
objects on the screen and domain knowledge As 
an example of the latter if the student draws an 
acceleration vector which is incorrect but not 
opposite to the velocity vector a different 
response will be generated 
 Discussion 
Many previous dialoguebased ITSs have been 
implemented with finitestate machines either 
simple or augmented In the most common finite 
state mode each time the human user issues an 
utterance the processor educes it to one of a 
small number of categories These categories 
represent the possible transitions between states 
Thus history can be stored and context 
considered only by expanding the number of 
states This approach puts an arbitrary restriction 
on the amount of context or depth of 
conversational nesting that can be considered 
More importantly it misses the significant 
generalization that these types of dialogues are 
hierarchical larger units contain repeated 
instances of the same smaller units in different 
sequences and instantiated with different values 
Furthermore the finitestate machine approach 
does not allow the author to drop one line of 
attack and replace it by another without hard 
coding every possible transition 
It is also clear that the dialoguebased approach 
has many benefits over the hintsequence 
approach In addition to providing a multistep 
teaching methods with new content it can 
respond flexibly to a variety of student answers at 
each step and take context into account when 
generating a reply 
 Related work  
Wenger  still the chief textbook on ITSs 
states that using a global planner to control an ITS 
is too inefficient to try This is no longer true if 
indeed it ever was Vassileva  proposes a 
system based on ANDOR graphs with a separate 
set of rules for reacting to unexpected events 
Lehuen Nicolle and Luzzati  present a 
method of dialogue analysis that produces 
schemata very similar to ours Earlier dialogue 
based ITSs that use augmented finitestate 
machines or equivalent include CIRCSIMTutor 
Woo et al  Zhouet al  and the 
system described by Woolf  Cook  
uses levels of finitestate machines None of these 
systems provides for predicates with variables or 
unification 
 Conclusions 
In this paper we described APE an integrated 
planner and execution system that we have 
implemented as part of the Atlas dialogue 
manager APE uses HTNstyle operators and is 
based on reactive planning concepts Although 
APE is intended largely for use in domains with 
hierarchical multiturn plans it can be used to 
implement any conversationbased system where 
turns in the conversation may include graphical 
actions andor text We illustrated the use of APE 
with an example from the AtlasAndes physics 
tutor We showed that previous models based on 
finitestate machines are insufficient to handle the 
nested subdialogues and abandoned partial 
subdialogues that occur in practical applications 
We showed how APE generated a sample 
dialogue that earlier systems could not handle
