Introduction
purpose Atlas project to enlarge the
scope student interaction an intelligent
tutoring system to include coherent
conversational sequences including written
text GUI actions key component Atlas
APE Atlas Planning Engine justin
time planner specialized easy construction
quick generation hierarchically organized
dialogues APE a domain taskindependent
system Although date have used APE a
dialogue manager intelligent tutoring systems
APE could also used manage types
humancomputer conversation as advice
giving system an interactive help system
Planning an essential component a
dialoguebased Although are many
reasons using natural anguage an as
soon the student gives unexpected response
a tutor question tutor needs be able

plan order achieve goals well
respond appropriately the students tatement
Yet classical planning inappropriate
dialogue generation precisely it assumes
unchanging world more appropriate
approach the practical reason approach
pioneered Bratman According
Bratman human beings maintain plans prefer
follow but are also capable
changing plans the fly needed
Bratmans approach been introduced
computer science the name reactive
planning Georgeff Ingrand Wilkins et
al
this paper discuss rationale the use
reactive planning well the use the
hierarchical task network HTN style plan
operators we describe APE Atlas
Planning Engine dialogue planner have
implemented embody above concepts
demonstrate use APE showing we
used add dialogue capability to an
existing the Andes physics tutor showing
dialogues AtlasAndes generate
demonstrate advantages this architecture
the finitestate machine approach dialogue
management
Integrated planning execution
dialogue generation
Practical reason the BDI model
an planning required order ensure
coherent conversation well to accomplish
tutorial goals it impossible plan whole
conversation advance the student
respond freely every turn as human beings
cannot plan daily lives advance of
possible changes conditions Classical planning
algorithms inappropriate the tutor
must able change plans based the

students responses
this reason have adopted ideas the
philosopher Michael Bratman
Bratman uses term practical reason
describe analysis since is concerned
to reason practical matters human
beings planning required order
accomplish ones goals Bratmans key insight
human beings tend follow plan they
one although are capable dropping
intention changing partial plan
necessary other words human beings not
decide to from scratch each turn
Bratman others have adopted
approach use tripartite mental model
includes beliefs desires intentions Bratman
Israel Pollack Pollack Georgeff
et al hence name BDI model
Beliefs are uninstantiated plans the
speakers head reified the plan library
Desires expressed the agents goals
Intentions plan steps the agent
committed but yet acted are stored an
agenda Thus agents partial plan
achieving goal a network intentions plan
be left a partially expanded state it
necessary refine further
Implementation via reactive planning
Bratmans approach been elaborated a
computer science context subsequent
researchers Bratman Israel Pollack
Pollack Georgeff et al Reactive
planning Georgeff Ingrand Wilkins et
al originally known integrated
planning execution one way
implementing Bratmans model Originally
developed realtime control the space
shuttle reactive planning since used a
variety other domains the Atlas project
developed reactive planner called APE
Atlas Planning Engine uses ideas
conduct conversation each student
response planner choose continue
previous intention change something the
plan respond better the students utterance
Like reactive planners APE a
hierarchical task network HTN style planner
Yang Erol Hendler Nau
Hierarchical decomposition asserts each goal
be achieved via series subgoals instead
relying meansend reasoning Hierarchical
decomposition more appropriate dialogue
generation a number reasons First
decomposition better suited the type large
scale dialogue planning required a realworld
tutoring system it easier establish a
human speaker say a given situation
be able understand in sufficient detail
generality do meansend planning Second
Hierarchical decomposition minimizes search
time Third dialogues taskoriented
a hierarchical structure Grosz Sidner
such case matching structure
domain simplifies operator development
they often derived transcripts
human tutoring sessions hierarchy
information also useful determining
appropriate referring expressions Fourth inter
leaved planning execution important
dialogue generation we cannot predict
human users future utterances an HTNbased
system is straightforward implement
interleaved planning execution one
needs expand portion the plan
about be executed Finally conversation
in certain sense trace the plan other
words care much about actions
generated the planner the states involved
whether implicitly explicitly specified
Hierarchical decomposition provides trace
naturally
Background Andes physics tutor
Andes Gertner Conati VanLehn an
intelligent tutoring system the domain first
year college physics Andes teaches via coached
problem solving VanLehn coached
problem solving tutoring system tracks
student the latter attempts solve problem
the student gets stuck deviates far a
correct solution path tutoring system provides
hints other assistance
sample Andes problem shown mid
solution Figure physics problem given
the upperleft corner a picture it
Next picture the student begun
sketch vectors involved using GUI buttons
along lefthand edge the screen the

student draws vectors Andes the student
cooperatively fill the variable definitions the
upperright corner Later student use
space to write equations connecting
variables
this example elevator decelerating
acceleration vector face opposite
direction the velocity vector the
acceleration vector went same direction the
velocity vector speed the elevator would
increase it would crash the ground
an important issue beginning physics
occurs five Andes problems
such errors occur Andes turns
incorrect item red provides hints students
the lowerleft corner the screen sample
hints shown the order student would
encounter is shown Fig hints
outputonly form natural language
student cant take initiative ask question
addition is way the system ask
student question lead student
multistep directed line reasoning Thus
no way use of effective rhetorical
methods used skilled human tutors as
analogy reductio ad absurdum Current
psychological research suggests active
methods students to answer
questions improve performance
tutoring systems

possible operators formed the original
operator chosen retryat be useful
author must provide multiple operators the
goal operator must a set

perpendicular the correct answer we
recognize the tutor specific replies
them order reduce number
draws acceleration vector same direction velocity
What the definition acceleration
Dont know
OK lets try If car driving along east way would have push it
make stop
West
Exactly opposite direction net force goes the opposite direction so
acceleration Try draw acceleration vector now
draws acceleration vector correctly
Figure Example generated ialogue

operators we must investigate
general methods handling student errors
particular plan investigate errorclassifying
predicates apply more one question
well the use intentionbased predicates
Since system covers one rule physics
albeit a variety ways plan make
these efficiency improvements adding
new rules physics testing with users
Preconditions the operators the plan
library utilize discourse interaction history
current goal hierarchy recent information as
tutors current goal the students latest
response shared information as model
objects the screen domain knowledge
example the latter the student draws
acceleration vector is incorrect not
opposite the velocity vector different
response be generated
Discussion
Many previous dialoguebased ITSs been
implemented finitestate machines either
simple augmented the common finite
state mode time human user issues
utterance processor educes to one a
small number categories categories
represent possible transitions states
Thus history be stored context
considered by expanding number
states approach puts arbitrary restriction
the amount context depth
conversational nesting can considered
importantly misses significant
generalization these types dialogues
hierarchical larger units contain repeated
instances the smaller units different
sequences instantiated different values
Furthermore finitestate machine approach
not allow author drop one line
attack replace by another without hard
coding every possible transition
is also clear the dialoguebased approach
many benefits the hintsequence
approach addition providing multistep
teaching methods new content can
respond flexibly a variety student answers
step take context account
generating reply
