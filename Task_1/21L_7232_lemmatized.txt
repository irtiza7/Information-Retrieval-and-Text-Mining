Introduction
purpose Atlas project to enlarge the
scope student interaction an intelligent
tutoring system to include coherent
conversational sequence including written
text GUI action key component Atlas
APE Atlas Planning Engine justin
time planner specialized easy construction
quick generation hierarchically organized
dialogue APE a domain taskindependent
system Although date have used APE a
dialogue manager intelligent tutoring system
APE could also used manage type
humancomputer conversation a advice
giving system an interactive help system
Planning an essential component a
dialoguebased Although are many
reason using natural anguage an a
soon the student give unexpected response
a tutor question tutor need be able

plan order achieve goal well
respond appropriately the student tatement
Yet classical planning inappropriate
dialogue generation precisely it assumes
unchanging world more appropriate
approach the practical reason approach
pioneered Bratman According
Bratman human being maintain plan prefer
follow but are also capable
changing plan the fly needed
Bratmans approach been introduced
computer science the name reactive
planning Georgeff Ingrand Wilkins et
al
this paper discus rationale the use
reactive planning well the use the
hierarchical task network HTN style plan
operator we describe APE Atlas
Planning Engine dialogue planner have
implemented embody above concept
demonstrate use APE showing we
used add dialogue capability to an
existing the Andes physic tutor showing
dialogue AtlasAndes generate
demonstrate advantage this architecture
the finitestate machine approach dialogue
management
Integrated planning execution
dialogue generation
Practical reason the BDI model
an planning required order ensure
coherent conversation well to accomplish
tutorial goal it impossible plan whole
conversation advance the student
respond freely every turn a human being
can not plan daily life advance of
possible change condition Classical planning
algorithm inappropriate the tutor
must able change plan based the

student response
this reason have adopted idea the
philosopher Michael Bratman
Bratman us term practical reason
describe analysis since is concerned
to reason practical matter human
being planning required order
accomplish one goal Bratmans key insight
human being tend follow plan they
one although are capable dropping
intention changing partial plan
necessary other word human being not
decide to from scratch each turn
Bratman others have adopted
approach use tripartite mental model
includes belief desire intention Bratman
Israel Pollack Pollack Georgeff
et al hence name BDI model
Beliefs are uninstantiated plan the
speaker head reified the plan library
Desires expressed the agent goal
Intentions plan step the agent
committed but yet acted are stored an
agenda Thus agent partial plan
achieving goal a network intention plan
be left a partially expanded state it
necessary refine further
Implementation via reactive planning
Bratmans approach been elaborated a
computer science context subsequent
researcher Bratman Israel Pollack
Pollack Georgeff et al Reactive
planning Georgeff Ingrand Wilkins et
al originally known integrated
planning execution one way
implementing Bratmans model Originally
developed realtime control the space
shuttle reactive planning since used a
variety other domain the Atlas project
developed reactive planner called APE
Atlas Planning Engine us idea
conduct conversation each student
response planner choose continue
previous intention change something the
plan respond better the student utterance
Like reactive planner APE a
hierarchical task network HTN style planner
Yang Erol Hendler Nau
Hierarchical decomposition asserts each goal
be achieved via series subgoals instead
relying meansend reasoning Hierarchical
decomposition more appropriate dialogue
generation a number reason First
decomposition better suited the type large
scale dialogue planning required a realworld
tutoring system it easier establish a
human speaker say a given situation
be able understand in sufficient detail
generality do meansend planning Second
Hierarchical decomposition minimizes search
time Third dialogue taskoriented
a hierarchical structure Grosz Sidner
such case matching structure
domain simplifies operator development
they often derived transcript
human tutoring session hierarchy
information also useful determining
appropriate referring expression Fourth inter
leaved planning execution important
dialogue generation we can not predict
human user future utterance an HTNbased
system is straightforward implement
interleaved planning execution one
need expand portion the plan
about be executed Finally conversation
in certain sense trace the plan other
word care much about action
generated the planner the state involved
whether implicitly explicitly specified
Hierarchical decomposition provides trace
naturally
Background Andes physic tutor
Andes Gertner Conati VanLehn an
intelligent tutoring system the domain first
year college physic Andes teach via coached
problem solving VanLehn coached
problem solving tutoring system track
student the latter attempt solve problem
the student get stuck deviate far a
correct solution path tutoring system provides
hint other assistance
sample Andes problem shown mid
solution Figure physic problem given
the upperleft corner a picture it
Next picture the student begun
sketch vector involved using GUI button
along lefthand edge the screen the

student draw vector Andes the student
cooperatively fill the variable definition the
upperright corner Later student use
space to write equation connecting
variable
this example elevator decelerating
acceleration vector face opposite
direction the velocity vector the
acceleration vector went same direction the
velocity vector speed the elevator would
increase it would crash the ground
an important issue beginning physic
occurs five Andes problem
such error occur Andes turn
incorrect item red provides hint student
the lowerleft corner the screen sample
hint shown the order student would
encounter is shown Fig hint
outputonly form natural language
student cant take initiative ask question
addition is way the system ask
student question lead student
multistep directed line reasoning Thus
no way use of effective rhetorical
method used skilled human tutor a
analogy reductio ad absurdum Current
psychological research suggests active
method student to answer
question improve performance

Exactly opposite direction net force go the opposite direction so
acceleration Try draw acceleration vector now
draw acceleration vector correctly
Figure Example generated ialogue

operator we must investigate
general method handling student error
particular plan investigate errorclassifying
predicate apply more one question
well the use intentionbased predicate
Since system cover one rule physic
albeit a variety way plan make
these efficiency improvement adding
new rule physic testing with user
Preconditions the operator the plan
library utilize discourse interaction history
current goal hierarchy recent information a
tutor current goal the student latest
response shared information a model
object the screen domain knowledge
example the latter the student draw
acceleration vector is incorrect not
opposite the velocity vector different
response be generated
Discussion
Many previous dialoguebased ITSs been
implemented finitestate machine either
simple augmented the common finite
state mode time human user issue
utterance processor educes to one a
small number category category
represent possible transition state
Thus history be stored context
considered by expanding number
state approach put arbitrary restriction
the amount context depth
conversational nesting can considered
importantly miss significant
generalization these type dialogue
hierarchical larger unit contain repeated
instance the smaller unit different
sequence instantiated different value
Furthermore finitestate machine approach
not allow author drop one line
attack replace by another without hard
coding every possible transition
is also clear the dialoguebased approach
many benefit the hintsequence
approach addition providing multistep
teaching method new content can
respond flexibly a variety student answer
step take context account
generating reply

APE intended largely use domain
hierarchical multiturn plan can used
implement conversationbased system
turn the conversation may include graphical
action andor text illustrated use APE
an example the AtlasAndes physic
tutor showed previous model based
finitestate machine insufficient handle
